# About 
This repository contains the analysis and visualization tool used in the following articles and thesis:

Digital Threads, Digital Twins, and the design process at various stages can be analyzed and visualized at the component level within this tool. Different policies can be compared (including designs) and their performances can be quantified. The tool is written in the context of the example design problem presented in the above works, though it can be modified to suite other design scenarios. All code is natively written in MATLAB R2018b on a Windows 10 64-bit machine.

# Quick Start
A demo ribweb has been setup for running and viewing.
1. Launch `visualizer.m`. From there, right-click in the right pane and select load. From the loading screen, load `Demos/RibWebSeed.mat`. 
1. Next, initialize policies by right-clicking in the right pane and selecting `Policies > Initialize`. 
1. Once all policies are initialized, evaluate the policies by right-clicking in the right pane and selecting `Policies > Evaluate`. 
1. After evaluation of the policies, you can navigate Digital Threads and Digital Twins for each policy using the search tree on the left. Additional viewing options for different tree levels can be accessed by right-clicking on figure axes that pop up.
1. To optimize policies, right-click in the right pane and select `Policies > Optimize`. To view the results of the optimization, re-evaluate the policies by selecting again `Policies > Evaluate`. Currently, optimization is done for one iteration across all stages and policies. This is controlled in the functions `bellmanBackup.m\bellmanBackup()` (for iterations) and `visualizer.m\optimizePolicies()` (for which policies to be run). For good results, it is recommended to run for at least 100 iterations (~approx 10-15 hrs on a Windows 10 64-bit laptop). The results in the works above have been run for over 2000 iterations.
